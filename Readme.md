# Habitat Control #

Control a reptile terrarium lighting and heating requirements to keep your pet happy! Record and log the sensor data and set triggers for when certain conditions are met.

Some examples include:

* Turn off day/night lamps instead of using a traditional analog timer (more accurate)
* Use as an advanced thermostat with multiple temperature sensors for the warm/cool side of the reptile terrarium
* and more!

The code is built to be customizable. If you need more advanced functionality you will be able to easily add it yourself or contribute to this project. Just submit a pull request!
